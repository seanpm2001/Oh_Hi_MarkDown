### I did not hit her! I did not!

### Oh Hi Mark

## Context

I commonly came across this joke in some communities online. In my mind, the idea of adding the word `down` to `mark` came to me. It would be stupid to make a markdown variant with this name, so I made this joke project on 2022, Thursday, May 12th.

A GIF or PNG image cannot be included for copyright reasons unfortunately.

This joke comes from the movie 'The Room' which I have not seen (I have only seen the >10 second clip) the scene can be found by searching for the term `Oh Hi Mark` or searching `The room - Rooftop scene`
